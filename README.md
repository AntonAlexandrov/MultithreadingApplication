# MultithreadingApplication
An attempt at creating a multithreading application that uses common searching and sorting alghorithms with Java 8
This is mainly just an exercise for implementing some algoritms and using multiple threads. The idea is the threads will use
different algorithms at the same time, that way I can compare the speeds and see which is faster.
